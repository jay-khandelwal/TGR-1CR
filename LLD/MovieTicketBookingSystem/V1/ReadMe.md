This code is a solid foundation, but you'll need to demonstrate more to ace a senior-level interview. Let me break it down:
What's Good (Interview âœ…)

Clean Architecture: Good separation of concerns with managers
SOLID Principles: Single responsibility, proper abstractions
Concurrency Handling: Seat locking mechanism shows you understand race conditions
Proper Encapsulation: Private fields, proper getters/setters
Real-world Thinking: Timeout handling, payment flow, booking states

What Interviewers Will Definitely Ask About
1. Database Design (Currently Missing)
java// They'll expect you to discuss:
// - How would you persist this data?
// - Database schema design
// - Indexing strategies for fast seat availability checks
// - ACID properties for booking transactions
2. Scalability Concerns

"What if 10,000 users try to book the same show simultaneously?"
Current locking is in-memory - won't work across multiple servers
Need distributed locking (Redis, Zookeeper)

3. Advanced Design Patterns
java// Missing patterns they might expect:
// - Observer pattern for booking notifications
// - Strategy pattern for different payment methods
// - Factory pattern for creating different seat types
// - Builder pattern for complex booking creation
4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

What if payment succeeds but booking confirmation fails?
How do you handle partial failures?
What about duplicate bookings?

5. Performance Optimizations

Caching strategies
Database connection pooling
Async processing for non-critical operations

To Make It Interview-Ready, Add:
1. Interface Abstractions
javainterface PaymentGateway {
    PaymentResult processPayment(PaymentRequest request);
}

interface NotificationService {
    void sendBookingConfirmation(Booking booking);
}
2. Configuration Management
javaclass BookingConfig {
    private final int seatLockTimeoutMinutes;
    private final int maxSeatsPerBooking;
    // ... other configs
}
3. Audit & Logging
javaclass BookingAuditLog {
    public void logBookingAttempt(String userId, String showId, List<String> seats);
    public void logPaymentTransaction(String bookingId, PaymentStatus status);
}
4. API Layer (If They Ask)
java@RestController
class BookingController {
    @PostMapping("/bookings")
    public ResponseEntity<BookingResponse> createBooking(@RequestBody BookingRequest request);
}
Level-Based Expectations:
Junior (2-3 years): Your current code is perfect
Mid-level (3-5 years): Need +database design, +basic scalability discussion
Senior (5+ years): Need +distributed systems, +microservices architecture, +system design
Interview Tips:

Start Simple: Present your current code first
Show Growth: "Here's my basic design, but in production I'd also consider..."
Ask Questions: "Should I assume this is a single-server or distributed system?"
Discuss Trade-offs: "In-memory locking is fast but doesn't scale vs Redis locking is slower but distributed"

Quick Wins to Add:
java// 1. Add this enum for better error handling
enum BookingError {
    SEAT_NOT_AVAILABLE,
    PAYMENT_FAILED,
    USER_NOT_FOUND,
    SHOW_NOT_FOUND
}

// 2. Add builder pattern
class BookingRequest {
    private String userId;
    private String showId;
    private List<String> seatIds;
    // ... builder methods
}

// 3. Add notification capability
interface BookingObserver {
    void onBookingConfirmed(Booking booking);
    void onBookingFailed(Booking booking);
}
Bottom Line: Your code shows you can write clean, working code. To pass senior interviews, be ready to discuss how you'd scale it, handle failures, and integrate with real-world systems. But for mid-level positions, this is definitely solid!
The key is presenting it confidently and being ready to evolve the design based on their follow-up questions.
